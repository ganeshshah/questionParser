Q.28) A tank is filled with water. There are four
      pipes attached to the tank from which
      pipe A and pipe B are outlet pipes that
      can empty the tank in 10 hours and
      30 hours, respectively, working alone.
      Pipe C and D are inlet pipes and can fill
      the empty tank in 20 hours and 15 hours,
      respectively, working alone. Pipe A is
      opened on Monday at 3 pm, at 5 pm pipe
      B is opened, at 6 pm pipe C is opened,
      and pipe D is also opened at 7 pm. At
      what time the filled tank will be empty?

Q.29) A worker alone can complete a piece
      of work in 63 days. On the Nth day
      (N ≥ 2) the number of workers becomes
      the number of workers on (N − 1)th day
      thrice. Moreover, the efficiency of each
      worker on the Nth day is two-thirds of
      his efficiency on (N − 1)th day. In how
      many days will they be able to complete
      the original work? (Assume that all the
      workers are of the same efficiency.)

      (A) 7
      (B) 6
      (C) 8
      (D) 5

Answer- B)


Q.30) Thirty workers all working with the same
      efficiency started a job and worked on
      it for 30 days. From day 31 onwards, a
      new worker with the same efficiency as
      previous workers joined them every day
      till the job was finished. It took exactly
      38 days (since the beginning of the work)
      to finish the entire job. Now, the same
      job has to be done, starting with the
      minimum possible number of workers
      when it is known that a worker will quit
      the job every day after the first day. How
      many days will it take to finish the job in
      such a manner?
      (A) 40 days
      (B) 44 days
      (C) 48 days
      (D) 52 days
