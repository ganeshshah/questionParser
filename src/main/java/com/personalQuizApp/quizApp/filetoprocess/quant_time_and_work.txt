Q.12) A cistern is attached to a few pipes.
    Some of them are large pipes and some
    of them are small pipes. Each of these
    pipes can be used to fill or empty the
    tank. The filling speed of each pipe is 10
    times the speed of its emptying capacity.
    Further, all the large pipes have the same
    filling rate among themselves and all the
    small pipes have the same filling rate
    among themselves. One large pipe and
    seven small pipes can empty the cistern
    in 6 minutes, whereas one large pipe
    and three small pipes can fill it in just 1
    minute. How many minutes will one large
    pipe and one small pipe together take to
    empty a completely filled cistern?

    attached to the tank are of the square
    cross-section with sides of 2 cm, 4 cm, 8
    cm, and 16 cm, respectively. If the smallest
    pipe alone takes 60 minutes to fill the
    tank, how much time (in seconds) will it
    take for all four pipes to fill the tank?
    (A) 42.35 seconds
    (B) 41.45 seconds
    (C) 40.4 seconds
